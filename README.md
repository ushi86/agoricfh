  **BLOCKPOINTS**

  This project is a blockchain-integrated website designed to reward customers with NFTs when they shop. It leverages the Agoric platform to enable seamless interaction with smart contracts and cross-chain capabilities. 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Key Features:
Customer Rewards with NFTs:

Shoppers earn unique NFTs as rewards for their purchases.

---> Each NFT can represent a loyalty badge, collectible, or proof of transaction, adding a gamified aspect to the shopping experience.
Collateral Locking for Added Features:

---> Customers can lock collateral (e.g., tokens) within the platform to access premium benefits or features.
Cross-Chain Transactions:

---> The platform enables NFT transfers across multiple blockchains, giving users greater flexibility and interoperability.
Smart Contract Integration:

Built on the Agoric framework, the smart contract handles NFT minting, collateral management, and cross-chain operations.

**SMART CONTRACT WRITTEN FOR AGORIC**

User Workflow:
* A customer shops on the platform and earns rewards in the form of NFTs.

* The NFT is minted on the blockchain and issued to the userâ€™s wallet.
  
Customers can:

--> View their NFT collection.
--> Transfer NFTs across different blockchains-orchestration by Agoric ;)
--> Lock collateral for access to special services.
